BUGS I
------
I didn't put docs in my game, maybe will later.
Actually it's more or less a copy of the Nintendo
game Dr.Mario.
ALTHOUGH it does not have the look & feel! ;)

So here it goes: use standard vi keys.
select level & speed w/ j & k keys .return to accept
In the gameboard there are letters in reverse video,(or underlined)
your goal is to remove them by  placing 3 or more
of the same letters beside them or on top of them.
any  four letters in a row will be removed.
for example these will be removed from play:

AAAA  -horizonatly    or

O
O
O
O  - vertically

you can turn your playing piece by using 
a  : counter-clockwise
s  : clockwise

SPACE will drop pieces to the farthest point possible.

p : pause - hit again to continue

Users w/ uid 952 can also use the k key. wonder why??? :)

Any pieces on top of those removed will fall, possibly
removing more bugs or letters.(Bugs are reverse video letters)
your playing piece will continue downward until it hits something.
Next piece is displayed on top of board.if you stack to the top
so another piece cannot be added the game is over.
play speed will increase every 10 pieces. removal of all bugs
will result in an increase in level. 

That's about it I think. If the pieces are not dropping at a reasonable
rate, change (tme > 4) or the value in the usleep call in line
102. MANY thanks to the author of the usleep function, the program
was a BIG cpu hog before insertion.

Overview: the code is not very great, but the main purpose
behind this was to do something w/ curses and try a few different
things w/ C. Some things appear to be and are unnecessary,
and there are undoubtedly better ways to do things,
but it works! Sorry didn't put into a man page format,
but you have my permission to do so!
